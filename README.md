### PULSE V2 IS OUT

Please read the [changelog](https://pulsejs.org/v2/introduction/changelog.html) to ensure your old code is compatible.

Pulse is an application logic library for reactive Javascript frameworks with support for VueJS, React and React Native. Lightweight, modular and powerful, but most importantly easy to understand.

## Why Pulse?

After exploring the many options for Javascript state libraries, including the popular VueX and Redux, I felt like I needed a simpler solution. I wanted to get more out of a library than just state managementâ€• something that could provide solid structure for the **entire** application. It needed to be structured and simple, but also scalable. This library provides everything needed to get a reactive javascript front-end application working fast, taking care to follow best practices and to employ simple terminology that makes sense even to beginners.

I built this framework reflective of the architecture in which we use at Notify.me, and as a replacement for VueX at Notify also, making sure it is also compatible with React and vanilla environments. The team at Notify love it and I think you will too.
